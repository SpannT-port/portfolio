These screenshots show the steps for setting up Ubuntu in VirtualBox. 
In Power Up.png, notice that the machine name is "Linux (Initial Install) and the dropdown shows "Initial Install" -> "Current State". 
This is because I used the snapshot feature to take a snap of the machine with Ubuntu at its unaltered state. 
If a lot of changes will be made to the machine, it is best practice to have a system default available to restore.
